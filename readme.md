## About

I am an aspiring Software Engineer that has dedicated most of my life to learning and growing in the Nature Sciences as
Neuroscience had always been what I was most passionate about. I'm rather new to the world of IT, having my first
introduction to programming in **2019**. It was like love at first sight. I had found something else I was deeply passionate
about.

As I skimmed the surface of this new world I came to realize how much I liked the workflow and processes of working as a
Software Engineer and thus made the difficult decision of changing my path in life, starting completely from scratch. I
have been in a transient phase ever since until **autumn 2021** as I departed the old world and traveled to this new world
to explore and map it. To figure out my new path and what technologies I would like to work mostly with. I have gained
proficiency in many technologies during this time, however, I have learned that my tool of choice is the programming
language **Python**. It is an elegant tool that is applicable nearly everywhere.

My aim is to some day work at the intersection of Neuroscience and Technology, as an engineer that helps to develop the
interface between the brain and the computer.
